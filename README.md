REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

# Project Summary

> I think my project summary is going to be a little bit dry :). Before this course I was already familiar with JavaScript so developing my project didn't cause any big problems. My project is quite simple too.

> I started by creating the a basic prototype of game where two players could make moves. Then I realized that light theme was... well, not the great (no offense to light theme lovers) and added a dark theme too. The bot was added just to make the game more fun. At first it made random moves but that was too easy to beat so I decided to improve it with simple strategy so that's brings some sort of challenge.

> The only thing I would like to improve is the UI, but unfortunately I'm not a designer, so it's functional rather than stylish.

# User Guide

> Well, I wrote a simple tic-tac-coe game and I hope everyone knows the rules but anyway I will write them :). You are able to click on any cell to place your mark, goal is to try to complete a row, column or diagonal of three matching symbols. Winning cells are highlited with green color and you can restart the game at any time. You can also switch between light and dark themes using theme toggler in the right top corner. If you prefer to play against bot, you can enable it directly. You can also choose the difficulty level, from Easy (random moves) or Hard (smarter strategy that tries to block or win). Enjoy the game!
